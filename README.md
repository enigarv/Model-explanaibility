**Model Explainability** is a broad concept of analyzing and understanding the results provided by ML/DL models. It is most often used in the context of “black-box” models, for which it is difficult to demonstrate, how did the model arrive at a specific decision.

In this repository I show how to use two well-known model explainability frameworks: LIME and Grad-CAM.
